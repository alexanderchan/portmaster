# Ralph Progress Log
# Project: port-master
# Branch: ralph/port-master-cli

## Codebase Patterns
- CLI package lives in `packages/cli/` directory
- Use `pnpm typecheck` to run type checking in the CLI package
- Use `pnpm build` to build the CLI with tsup
- tsup.config.ts adds shebang automatically via banner option - do NOT add shebang in source files
- pnpm workspace configured to include `packages/*`
- Use `.js` extension in TypeScript imports for ESM compatibility (e.g., `import { getDb } from "./db.js"`)
- CLI commands live in `packages/cli/src/commands/` directory
- Commands export both a core function (for testing) and an executeX function (for CLI output)

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Initialized project structure with packages/cli directory
- Created package.json with name 'port-master', type 'module', bin entry
- Added all required dependencies: better-sqlite3, commander, zod, @clack/prompts
- Added all required devDependencies: typescript, tsx, @types/better-sqlite3, tsup, @types/node
- Created tsconfig.json with ESM, strict mode, NodeNext module resolution
- Created tsup.config.ts for build configuration
- Created minimal src/index.ts entry point with shebang
- Verified typecheck and build both pass
- **Files changed:** packages/cli/package.json, packages/cli/tsconfig.json, packages/cli/tsup.config.ts, packages/cli/src/index.ts, pnpm-workspace.yaml, pnpm-lock.yaml
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - This is a monorepo with pnpm workspaces
  - CLI package is independent from the root Next.js app
  - tsup handles ESM bundling and shebang injection

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Created database module at packages/cli/src/db.ts
- Database path: ~/.config/port-master/ports.db
- Auto-creates parent directories using mkdirSync with recursive option
- Schema includes: id, directory, port_type, port, description, created_at, updated_at
- Added UNIQUE constraint on (directory, port_type)
- Added UNIQUE constraint on port (globally unique)
- Exported getDb() function for lazy initialization
- Added closeDb() utility for cleanup
- Uses WAL journal mode for better performance
- Created indexes for directory, port_type, and port columns
- **Files changed:** packages/cli/src/db.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - better-sqlite3 is synchronous and doesn't need async/await
  - Use `datetime('now')` for SQLite default timestamps
  - WAL mode improves concurrent read performance

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Created port allocation module at packages/cli/src/ports.ts
- Implemented PORT_RANGES constant with type-specific ranges:
  - dev: 3100-3999
  - pg/postgres: 5500-5599
  - redis: 6400-6499
  - mongo: 27100-27199
  - db: 5600-5699
- CATCH_ALL_RANGE: 9100-9999 for unknown types
- Implemented findAvailablePort(type) function that:
  - Gets all used ports from database
  - Finds first unused port in type-specific range
  - Falls back to catch-all range if primary is exhausted
  - Throws error if all ports exhausted
- Added getPortRange(type) helper function
- **Files changed:** packages/cli/src/ports.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use .js extension in TypeScript imports for ESM compatibility
  - Port types are case-insensitive (normalized to lowercase)

## 2026-01-30 - US-004
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Created Zod schemas and TypeScript types at packages/cli/src/types.ts
- PortEntry schema with id, directory, port_type, port, description (nullable), timestamps
- KnownPortTypeSchema as enum of known types (dev, pg, postgres, redis, mongo, db)
- PortTypeSchema as flexible string type for custom types
- CLI options schemas for all commands:
  - GetOptionsSchema (with dir, desc options)
  - ListOptionsSchema (with verbose, json options)
  - InfoOptionsSchema (with dir, json options)
  - RmOptionsSchema (with dir, interactive options)
  - CleanupOptionsSchema (with dryRun, interactive options)
- Utility schemas: PortRange, PortDisplayInfo, CreatePortEntry
- All types exported via z.infer<typeof Schema>
- **Files changed:** packages/cli/src/types.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Zod schemas provide runtime validation + TypeScript types in one definition
  - Use z.infer<typeof Schema> to export types automatically
  - Separate schemas for database records vs create inputs (without auto-generated fields)

## 2026-01-30 - US-005
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Implemented 'get' command at packages/cli/src/commands/get.ts
- Command: port-master get <type> gets or creates a port for a service type
- Returns existing port if (directory, type) exists in database
- Creates and returns new port if none exists using findAvailablePort()
- Output is just the port number (no extra text) for scripting
- --desc 'text' adds optional description to the port entry
- --dir /path targets specific directory instead of cwd
- 'add' command works as alias for 'get' (same handler)
- Updated src/index.ts to remove shebang (tsup adds it via banner)
- Registered both get and add commands with commander
- **Files changed:** packages/cli/src/commands/get.ts, packages/cli/src/index.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Don't include shebang in source files when tsup has banner config for it (causes duplication)
  - Commander aliases can be implemented as separate commands calling the same handler
  - Use resolve() from node:path to normalize directory paths

## 2026-01-30 - US-007
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Implemented 'info' command at packages/cli/src/commands/info.ts
- Command: port-master info shows all ports for current working directory
- Shows directory name and full path at the top
- Lists each port type with port number and description
- --dir /path targets specific directory instead of cwd
- --json outputs JSON for scripting
- Shows helpful message "No ports assigned to this directory." when empty
- **Files changed:** packages/cli/src/commands/info.ts, packages/cli/src/index.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Re-use the same database query patterns from list command
  - For project-specific commands, always show the full path context
---

## 2026-01-30 - US-008
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Implemented 'rm' command at packages/cli/src/commands/rm.ts
- Command: port-master rm <type> removes a port assignment
- --dir /path targets specific directory instead of cwd
- --interactive (-i) prompts for confirmation before removing using @clack/prompts
- Fails with clear error if no matching assignment exists
- Outputs removed port number on success
- **Files changed:** packages/cli/src/commands/rm.ts, packages/cli/src/index.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use @clack/prompts confirm() for interactive prompts
  - Always check if entry exists before attempting delete and show clear error
---

## 2026-01-30 - US-009
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Implemented 'cleanup' command at packages/cli/src/commands/cleanup.ts
- Command: port-master cleanup removes entries for deleted directories
- Checks filesystem with existsSync() for each directory in database
- --dry-run (-n) shows what would be removed without removing
- --interactive (-i) prompts for confirmation before removing
- Reports count of removed entries
- **Files changed:** packages/cli/src/commands/cleanup.ts, packages/cli/src/index.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use existsSync() to check if directories still exist on filesystem
  - Cleanup operations should always support dry-run mode

## 2026-01-31 - US-010
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Verified CLI entry point with help text was already implemented
- Removed duplicate shebang from src/index.ts (tsup adds it via banner)
- Verified all acceptance criteria:
  - src/index.ts as main entry with shebang (handled by tsup)
  - port-master --help shows all commands with descriptions
  - port-master <command> --help shows command-specific options
  - Help text includes usage examples
  - Shows storage location (~/.config/port-master/ports.db)
  - --version shows package version
  - Typecheck passes
- **Files changed:** packages/cli/src/index.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The US-010 feature was already committed but PRD wasn't updated
  - Always verify PRD is updated after each story completion

## 2026-01-30 - US-006
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Implemented 'list' command at packages/cli/src/commands/list.ts
- Command: port-master list shows all assigned ports across projects
- Shows table format with columns: PORT, TYPE, DIRECTORY, DESCRIPTION
- Directory shown as basename by default
- --verbose (-v) shows full absolute paths instead of basenames
- --json outputs JSON array for scripting/automation
- Results sorted by port number ascending (via SQL ORDER BY)
- Shows "No ports have been assigned yet." when database is empty
- Calculates dynamic column widths based on content for nice table alignment
- **Files changed:** packages/cli/src/commands/list.ts, packages/cli/src/index.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - When CLI options are optional (commander passes undefined if not provided), create a local interface with optional properties instead of using Zod-inferred types that may have defaults baked in
  - Use basename() from node:path to show short directory names
  - The SQL ORDER BY clause handles sorting, no need for JavaScript sort
